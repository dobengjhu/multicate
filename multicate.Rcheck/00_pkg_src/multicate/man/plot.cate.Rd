\title{Plot Diagnostics for a CATE Object}
\usage{
\method{plot}{cate}(x, which_plot = 1:5, ask = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{list. An object resulting from \link{estimate_cate}.}

\item{which_plot}{numeric vector. A vector indicating which plots should be generated.}

\item{ask}{logical. When TRUE, the user is asked before each plot, see
\link[graphics:par]{par(ask = .)}.}
}
\description{
Five plots (selectable by \code{which_plot}) currently available: a histogram of estimated conditional
average treatment effects (CATEs), a boxplot of CATEs stratified by study membership, a plot of
95\% confidence intervals for all CATEs sorted in order to CATE estimate value, a best linear
projection (only available when \code{estimation_method} is set to "causalforest"), and an
interpretation tree.
